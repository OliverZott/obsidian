In astrophysical spectroscopy, the term “UV continuum spectral break” refers to a significant change or discontinuity in the intensity of the ultraviolet (UV) continuum spectrum of an astronomical object. [The UV continuum spectrum is a broad, continuous range of ultraviolet wavelengths produced by the interactions of a large number of atoms, ions, or molecules](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Spectral+Continuum)[1](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Spectral+Continuum).

[One example of a UV continuum spectral break is the Balmer jump or Balmer discontinuity, which is the difference in intensity of the stellar continuum spectrum on either side of the limit of the Balmer series of hydrogen, at approximately 364.5 nm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_jump)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_jump).

[In the context of high-redshift galaxies, the UV continuum slope (denoted as beta) is often used to estimate their stellar metallicities (Z*) from stellar photospheric absorption features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06615)[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06615). [The UV continuum slope can be affected by factors such as dust attenuation](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/430/4/2885/1105742)[4](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/430/4/2885/1105742)[, and its interpretation can provide valuable insights into the physical properties and evolutionary history of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06615)[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06615)[4](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/430/4/2885/1105742).
